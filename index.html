                <p> Hello! I am currenlty expanding my knowldge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am 
                    always seeking out new learning opportunities to improve my skillset and stay up-to-date with
                    the latest trends and technologies in the field. On my free time, I enjoy 
                    spending time with my kids at the beach or just snuggling them wathching a silly
                    movie. I also enjoy learning about different types of house plants and their 
                    care requirements. Excited to begin my career as a web developer and am looking forward to using
                    my skills and creativity.

                                This password generator page uses JavaScript to generate a random 
                                password based on user input. Users can select the length of their 
                                password, choose to include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers,
                                 and special characters, and then generate a unique password. The page 
                                 is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface and provides a 
                                 secure and random password that can be used for various online accounts.

                                This was my pre-work for the UC Berkeley Bootcamp. I was able to accomplish all
                                the requirments for this project and upload what was needed. From this project I
                                gained the basic skills on setitng up my enviroments. I was able to create code (page)
                                use git to push these to my github and other functions I was not familiar
                                with. Overall I learned a lot to prepare me for Day 1 at the bootcamp!
