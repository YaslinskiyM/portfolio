                <p> Hello! I am currenlty expanding my knowldge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am 
                    always seeking out new learning opportunities to improve my skillset and stay up-to-date with
                    the latest trends and technologies in the field. On my free time, I enjoy 
                    spending time with my kids at the beach or just snuggling them wathching a silly
                    movie. I also enjoy learning about different types of house plants and their 
                    care requirements. Excited to begin my career as a web developer and am looking forward to using
                    my skills and creativity.
